AXIOM is a **neuro‑symbolic cognitive prosthetic** designed to operate as an **ADA‑aligned assistive system** (Title II/III) with **offline‑first** operation, a sealed **local vault**, and **clear legal interaction hooks** for real‑world use (schools, code enforcement, housing, and general access). This repository provides the **public core**: minimal, runnable modules and documentation that demonstrate the architecture, safety model, and compliance surfaces without exposing private research bundles.

> **Disclaimer**: AXIOM is assistive technology and developer tooling. It is not medical or legal advice. Use at your own risk and consult qualified counsel where required.

## Why “ADA‑Protected”?

AXIOM treats cognitive support as an *access* need. The software is built to help users **request accommodations**, **log interactions**, and **preserve evidence** in ways that map to disability law workflows (e.g., ADA Title II/III, Section 504). Concretely, that means:

- **Accommodation Hooks** — first‑class methods to request accommodations and log denials with timestamps.
- **Evidence Vault** — encrypted local storage for notes, audio/text logs, and artifacts under user control.
- **De‑Escalation Scripts** — on‑device prompts for school, police/code‑enforcement, transit, and housing staff.
- **Offline‑First** — works without network connectivity; can export sharable “aid cards”/QR bundles when back online.

## Core Capabilities (Public Modules)

- **Neuro‑Symbolic Grid (SLCA)** — a minimal Spatial Leaky Competing Accumulator grid for symbolic decisions.
- **Compliance Layer (ADA Shield)** — APIs to request accommodations, log responses, and export evidence.
- **Navigator & Notes** — quick actions for route/find‑help and cognitive notes tied to evidence vault.
- **QR Bootstrap** — optional QR “beacons” that load a read‑only aid card and rights summary on other devices.
